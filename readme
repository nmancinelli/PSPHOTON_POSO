This version of the phonon code was modified from the original sent by Peter Shearer in 2012.
Modifications include:
	A focus on regional phases Po and So
	An oceanic lithosphere background model from sereno and orcutt
	The Monte Carlo method models anisotropic heterogeneity by using Born Scattering coefficients
		that vary based on ray angle.
		A_eff=Az*cos**2(theta)+Ax*sin**2(theta)
		Az: vertical correlation length
		Ax: horizontal correlation length
		theta: ray angle from vertical, arcsin(p*v)
	The scattering probability along each ray segment is computed by: sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2) ./afp.
		This approach is valid provided that dx,dy are much smaller than afp (tested)
	The scattering pattern for each scattering event is computed using the A_eff corrleation length from above.
	The scattering patterns are precomputed for each all possible ray angles between 0 and 90 degrees,
		with 1 degree spacing.
	The code now writes out true radial and transverse arrays.  The prior version only wrote all phonon energy
		in the horizontal plane as out.photon_rad.
	The receivers are placed on the ocean floor.  Downgoing phonons are counted in layer 4 (i.e. above
		the seabed interface), and upgoing phonons are counted in layer 6 (i.e. below the seabed interface).
	Intrinsic Q comes from a model by Booth, Forsyth, and ??? (2014).
		Q may have to be increased later due to scattering attenuation from the source.
	Initial heterogeneity model comes from Kennett and Furumura (2013a).


To do:
	Allow for topography on the seabed (or any interface).
